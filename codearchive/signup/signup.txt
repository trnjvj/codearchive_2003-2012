<textarea cols="60" rows="10">Terms of Service

1. Your Acceptance

   A. By using or visiting the ProLamp website or any ProLamp products, software, data feeds, and services provided to you on, from, or through the ProLamp website (collectively the "Service") you signify your agreement to (1) these terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service"), (2) ProLamp's privacy notice, found at http://www.ProLamp.com/t/privacy and incorporated herein by reference, and (3) ProLamp's Community Guidelines, found at http://www.ProLamp.com/t/community_guidelines and also incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to any of these terms, the ProLamp privacy notice, or the Community Guidelines, please do not use the Service.
   
   B. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version http://www.ProLamp.com/t/terms). ProLamp may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.

2. Service

   A. These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content on the Service. “Content” includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service. The Service includes all aspects of ProLamp, including but not limited to all products, software and services offered via the ProLamp website, such as the ProLamp channels, the ProLamp "Embeddable Player," the ProLamp "Uploader" and other applications.
   
   B. The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by ProLamp. ProLamp has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, ProLamp will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly relieve ProLamp from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.
   
   C. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.

3. ProLamp Accounts

   A. In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a ProLamp or ProLamp account. You may never use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify ProLamp immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
   
   B. Although ProLamp will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of ProLamp or others due to such unauthorized use.

4. General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions

ProLamp hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:

   A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without ProLamp's prior written authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the Embeddable Player).
   
   B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.
   
   C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service itself, the Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means ProLamp may designate.
   
   D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain ProLamp's prior written approval:
          * the sale of access to the Service;
          * the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or
          * the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from ProLamp appears on the same page and is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.
   E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:
          * uploading an original video to ProLamp, or maintaining an original channel on ProLamp, to promote your business or artistic enterprise;
          * showing ProLamp videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the advertising restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or
          * any use that ProLamp expressly authorizes in writing.

      (For more information about what constitutes a prohibited commercial use, see our FAQ.)
   
   F. If you use the Embeddable Player on your website, you may not modify, build upon, or block any portion or functionality of the Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the ProLamp website.
   
   G. If you use the ProLamp Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time from ProLamp. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Uploader and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit ProLamp to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.
   
   H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the ProLamp servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ProLamp grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. ProLamp reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Service with respect to their Content.
   
   I. In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws.
  
   J. ProLamp reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time.

5. Your Use of Content

In addition to the general restrictions above, the following restrictions and conditions apply specifically to your use of Content.

   A. The Content on the Service, and the trademarks, service marks and logos ("Marks") on the Service, are owned by or licensed to ProLamp, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under the law.
   
   B. Content is provided to you AS IS. You may access Content for your information and personal use solely as intended through the provided functionality of the Service and as permitted under these Terms of Service. You shall not download any Content unless you see a “download” or similar link displayed by ProLamp on the Service for that Content. You shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for any other purposes without the prior written consent of ProLamp or the respective licensors of the Content. ProLamp and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the Content.
   
   C. You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Service or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the Content therein.
   
   D. You understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to Content from a variety of sources, and that ProLamp is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Content. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against ProLamp with respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to indemnify and hold harmless ProLamp, its owners, operators, affiliates, licensors, and licensees to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the Service.

6. Your Content and Conduct

   A. As a ProLamp account holder you may submit Content to the Service, including videos and user comments. You understand that ProLamp does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any Content you submit.
   
   B. You shall be solely responsible for your own Content and the consequences of submitting and publishing your Content on the Service. You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to publish Content you submit; and you license to ProLamp all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such Content for publication on the Service pursuant to these Terms of Service.
   
   C. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. However, by submitting Content to ProLamp, you hereby grant ProLamp a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and ProLamp's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms of Service. The above licenses granted by you in video Content you submit to the Service terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your videos from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that ProLamp may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in user comments you submit are perpetual and irrevocable.
   
   D. You further agree that Content you submit to the Service will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant ProLamp all of the license rights granted herein.
   
   E. You further agree that you will not submit to the Service any Content or other material that is contrary to the ProLamp Community Guidelines, currently found at http://www.ProLamp.com/t/community_guidelines, which may be updated from time to time, or contrary to applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.
   
   F. ProLamp does not endorse any Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and ProLamp expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Content. ProLamp does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Service, and ProLamp will remove all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights. ProLamp reserves the right to remove Content without prior notice.

7. Account Termination Policy

   A. ProLamp will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.
   
   B. ProLamp reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. ProLamp may at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user'su account for submitting such material in violation of these Terms of Service.

8. Digital Millennium Copyright Act

   A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):
          * A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
          * Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
          * Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;
          * Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;
          * A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
          * A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

            ProLamp's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is Shadie Farazian, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, email: copyright@ProLamp.com, fax: 650-872-8513. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to ProLamp customer service through http://www.ProLamp.com/support/ProLamp. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.
   
   B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:
          * Your physical or electronic signature;
          * Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
          * A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and
          * Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

            If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, ProLamp may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.

﻿ProLamp Terms of Service

Welcome to ProLamp!

1. Your relationship with ProLamp

    1.1 Your use of ProLamp’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by ProLamp under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and ProLamp. “ProLamp” means ProLamp Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

    1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with ProLamp, your agreement with ProLamp will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.

    1.3 Your agreement with ProLamp will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.

    1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and ProLamp in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.

    1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.

2. Accepting the Terms

    2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.

    2.2 You can accept the Terms by:

        (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by ProLamp in the user interface for any Service; or

        (B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that ProLamp will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

    2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with ProLamp, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.

    2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.

3. Language of the Terms

    3.1 Where ProLamp has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with ProLamp.

    3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.

4. Provision of the Services by ProLamp

    4.1 ProLamp has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of ProLamp itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.

    4.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that ProLamp may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at ProLamp’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform ProLamp when you stop using the Services.

    4.4 You acknowledge and agree that if ProLamp disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.

    4.5 You acknowledge and agree that while ProLamp may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by ProLamp at any time, at ProLamp’s discretion.

5. Use of the Services by you

    8.3 ProLamp reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service. For some of the Services, ProLamp may provide tools to filter out explicit sexual content.

In addition, there are commercially available services and software to limit access to material that you may find objectionable.

If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.

    20.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and ProLamp and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which ProLamp may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and ProLamp in relation to the Services.

    20.4 You agree that if ProLamp does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which ProLamp has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of ProLamp’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to ProLamp.

    20.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.

    20.7 The Terms, and your relationship with ProLamp under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and ProLamp agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that ProLamp shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
